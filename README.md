# charms for Volcano

## Description

Volcano is a batch system built on Kubernetes. 

It provides a suite of mechanisms that are commonly required by many 
classes of batch & elastic workload including: machine learning/deep learning,
bioinformatics/genomics and other "big data" applications. 
These types of applications typically run on generalized domain frameworks 
like TensorFlow, Spark, Ray, PyTorch, MPI, etc, which Volcano integrates with.


Charmhub package name: operator-template

## Deployment

### Quickstart
The suite of Volcano charms can be deployed within any kubernetes cluster so long as one has a valid admin token in a kubeconfig.

If deploying to an existing machine based juju controller, you'll first need to add a kubernetes-cloud with [`add-k8s`](https://juju.is/docs/olm/juju-add-k8s)

```bash
KUBECONFIG=path/to/my/kubeconfig juju add-k8s k8s-cloud
```

Next, create a kubernetes namespace for volcano with a juju model

```bash
juju add-model volcano-system
```

Then deploy the bundle from charmhub
```bash
juju deploy volcano --trust
```

### The full process

```bash
juju add-model volcano-system
juju deploy volcano-admission --trust
juju deploy volcano-controllers --trust
juju deploy volcano-scheduler --trust
```

## Integrations

### Certificates
The volcano admission service is exposed as a service on port 443 for internal communication and comes
by default with self-signed certificates for this service.  Its possible to relate to a certificate 
provider and have its certs generated by a trusted third-party like vault or easyrsa. 

```bash
CERT_MODEL=<name of certificate model>
juju switch $CERT_MODEL
juju offer <certificate-application>:client certificates
juju switch volcano-system
juju consume admin/${CERT_MODEL}.certificates
juju relate volcano-admission:certificates certificates
```
