  Volcano is a batch system built on Kubernetes. 
  It provides a suite of mechanisms that are commonly required by many 
  classes of batch & elastic workload including: machine learning/deep learning,
  bioinformatics/genomics and other "big data" applications. 
  These types of applications typically run on generalized domain frameworks 
  like TensorFlow, Spark, Ray, PyTorch, MPI, etc, which Volcano integrates with.
